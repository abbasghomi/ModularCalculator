A modular and extensible calculator application built with .NET 8, leveraging the power of the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) to support dynamic plugins for different mathematical operations.

## 🌟 Features

- **Modular Design:** Easily extend the calculator with new operations by adding plugins.
- **Dynamic Plugin Discovery:** Automatically discover and load operation plugins at runtime.
- **Tested and Reliable:** Comprehensive unit tests ensure the reliability of each component.
